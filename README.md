# Indian-CPI-Inflation
This project explores India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation trends over the past decade. It focuses on sector-wise inflation contributors in urban and rural areas using comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📌 Objectives
- To identify high-inflation commodities and their impact across rural and urban populations.
- To analyze temporal inflation patterns and develop actionable economic insights.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **CPI Segmentation:** Sector-wise CPI trends analyzed for food, housing, fuel, transport, and education from 2013 to 2023.
- **Inflation Drivers:** Vegetables, oils, and housing emerged as top contributors to inflation, especially post-2021.
- **Policy Impact:** The analysis suggests differentiated inflation trends across rural and urban populations, advocating for location-specific subsidy planning.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel** for data cleaning and visualization.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation (planned for future enhancement).
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (optional) for visualizing trends.
